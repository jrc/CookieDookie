# Burn

## Manifest description

Clean up browser cruft and enhance privacy with one click.

## Store description

Ok yeah, you know how your browser gets crufty over time? Burn makes it easy to clean up.

You keep a list of allowed sites where you want to stay logged in. Then, whenever you want, you click a button to delete the cruft stored in your browser from the all other sites. By cruft, I mean the local data (cookies, cache, local storage) from sites that you don't care about.

No user data is collected by this extension. There is no backend. The code is open source.
