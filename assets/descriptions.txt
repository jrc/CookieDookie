Manifest description:

Clean up browser cruft and enhance privacy with one click.



Store description:

Yeah, you know how your browser gets crufty over time? Burn lets you clean it up.

You keep a list of your favorite sites where you want to stay logged in. Then, whenever you want, you click a button to delete the cruft in your browser from all other sites. By cruft, I mean all the local data (cookies, cache, local storage) from sites that you don't care about.

No user data is collected by this extension. There is no backend. The code is open source.
